# Compare Data Workspace

To get started, create a new workspace, add an src folder, and clone this repo into it. Then clone the jackal and jackal_simulator into src, catkin_make in the workspace's main directory, and source the setup.bash files for ROS Noetic and the workspace. To start the sim, do `roslaunch jackal_gazebo empty_world.launch` and `rosrun compare_data gazebo_eval.py`
